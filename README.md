# Scientific Agent Skills

A comprehensive collection of **72 Agent Skills** for scientific computing, research workflows, and data analysis. These skills automatically enhance AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Claude Code, and others) with deep domain knowledge across the entire scientific Python ecosystem.

## What Are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** are contextual knowledge modules that automatically load when an AI assistant detects relevant topics in your conversation. Instead of generic coding help, you get expert-level guidance tailored to specific scientific domains.

### How It Works

1. **You start coding** with scientific libraries (NumPy, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.)
2. **Skills auto-load** based on semantic matching of your code and questions
3. **AI gets expert knowledge** from detailed skill documentation
4. **You receive better assistance** with best practices, common patterns, and domain-specific solutions

### Example

When you describe your problem:
> "I need to process a large array of scientific data efficiently. How do I optimize NumPy operations for performance?"

Or when you ask:
> "What's the best way to handle missing values in pandas before training a machine learning model?"

The relevant skills (`numpy` or `pandas-performance`) automatically load, providing the AI with:
- 1,361 lines of expert documentation (for NumPy)
- Best practices for array operations
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Performance optimization techniques
- Real-world patterns and examples

The AI then gives you expert-level guidance tailored to your specific problem, not generic coding help.
